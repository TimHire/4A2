!     This subroutine calculates the fluxes into each cell and then sums them to
!     update the primary flow properties

!     Explicitly declare the required variables

      real, dimension(g%ni-1,g%nj) :: mass_j, flux_j
      integer :: i, j, ni, nj

!     Get the block size and store locally for convenience
      ni = g%ni; nj = g%nj

!     Setup the continuity equation by calculating the mass flow through
!     the facets in both the i and j-directions. Store these values in
!     "mass_i" and "mass_j"
!     INSERT
     
!     Apply the wall boundary condition by checking that two nodes at the
!     end of a facet are both on a wall, if so then the appropriate mass
!     flow array is set to have zero flow through that facet
      where(g%wall(1:ni-1,:) .and. g%wall(2:ni,:)) mass_j = 0 
      where(g%wall(:,1:nj-1) .and. g%wall(:,2:nj)) mass_i = 0 

!     Update the density with mass fluxes by calling "sum_fluxes"
!     INSERT

!     Setup the conservation of energy equation by calculated the enthalpy flux
!     and storing the values in "flux_i" and "flux_j", you will need "mass_i"
!     and "mass_j" from before
!     INSERT

!     Update the internal energy with enthalpy fluxes
!     INSERT

!     Setup the x-momentum equation including momentum flux and pressure forces
!     INSERT

!     Update the x-momentum with momentum flux
!     INSERT

!     Setup the y-momentum equation including momentum flux and pressure forces
!     INSERT

!     Update the y-momentum with momentum flux
!     INSERT

!     Add artificial viscosity by smoothing all of the primary flow variables
