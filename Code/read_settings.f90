!     Read in the application variables and gas constants, they are in the
!     standard input file which is already assigned to unit 5

!     Explicitly declare the required variables
      use types
      implicit none
      type(t_appvars), intent(out) :: av
      type(t_bconds), intent(out) :: bcs

!     Read the case name and trim to the required length
      read(5,*) tempname
      av%casename = trim(tempname)

!     You should read in the following variables sequentially and store them in
!     the dervived "av" datatype with the % syntax:
!         gam, rgas
!         cfl, sfac, d_max
!         nsteps
!         ni, nj
!     INSERT

!     Calculate other gas constants used throughout the calculation
      av%cp = av%rgas * av%gam / (av%gam - 1.0)
      av%cv = av%cp / av%gam
      av%fgam = (av%gam - 1.0) / av%gam

!     Scale the smoothing factor and convergence limits by cfl number, the 
!     changes over a timestep should be proportional to dt, which is 
!     proportional to cfl
      av%sfac = av%sfac * av%cfl
      av%d_max = av%d_max * av%cfl

!     Average convergence limit on residuals is set to half of the maximum
      av%d_avg = 0.5 * av%d_max

!     Read the inlet boundary condition data and store into the "bcs" datatype
!         pstag, tstag, alpha, rfin
!     INSERT

!     Convert the inlet angle to radians
      bcs%alpha = bcs%alpha * 3.14159 / 180.0

!     Calculate the inlet stagnation density "rostag"
!     INSERT

!     Read the outlet static pressure and store into the "bcs" datatype
!     INSERT

!     Print the settings to check they have been read, you can use this syntax
!     anywhere else you want in the program to debug your code
